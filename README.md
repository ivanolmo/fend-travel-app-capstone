# Front End Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Travel App

## Overview
This project combines what I've learned of HTML, CSS, and Javascript (with build tools, web APIs, and single page web apps mixed in).
This project is a travel application that utilizes 3 APIs. It allows you to enter a location you'll be traveling to, and it will show 
weather for the area and pictures of the general location.

## My Work
The base for this app was borrowed from my previous project [Weather Journal App](https://github.com/ivanolmo/fend-weather-journal-app).
